# 🌿 Parsely

**Herbarium Specimen Digitization Platform**

Parsely Core + Studio help herbaria, museums, and researchers digitize large volumes of specimen labels with modern AI in a clean, intuitive workflow.

🔗 **Live demo (pre-alpha): [parselystudio.com](https://parselystudio.com)**

> ⚠️ This demo is a **pre-alpha release**. Features are incomplete and downtime is expected.
> For stable local use, see the [Getting Started](#-getting-started) section below.

## ✨ What it does

Given a set of specimen label images, Parsely can:

- **Preprocess images** — crop, deskew, and auto-rotate to prepare for AI extraction.  
- **Run OCR** — call Google Vision OCR (or other engines) to extract text from images.  
- **Extract structured data** — send OCR + images to an LLM (currently Gemini 2.5 Pro) to parse into specimen fields (e.g., catalog number, taxon, collector).  
- **Edit + review** — provide a simple web UI for curators to view images, edit predictions, and export results to CSV.  

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone and install

If you don’t have Poetry yet:

```bash
pip3 install poetry
```

### 2. Configure environment

Create a `.env` file in the project root with:

```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key_here
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/credentials.json"
```

Optional: install pre-commit hooks (we use this to strip notebook metadata):

```bash
poetry run pre-commit install
```

## 🖥️ Usage

### Option A: Web App

1. Start the server:
     ```bash
     poetry run dev
     ```
2. Open [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)
3. Upload images → edit predictions → finalize CSV.
4. Processed files are stored in `/tmp`.

### Option B: Notebook

1. Open [`notebooks/herbarium_processor.ipynb`](notebooks/herbarium_processor.ipynb).
2. Point it to a directory of images (`img/bucket`).
